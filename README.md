# Deplace-Maison-clone-website
I challenged my front-end knowledge recreating a website. Take a look on: "https://www.deplacemaison.com" to test your skills.


Technologies used in the project:

<br />
<ul>
  <li>HTML/CSS</li>
  <li>Javascript</li>
  <li>JQuery</li>
  <li>GSAP (framework for animations)</li>
  <li>SASS</li>
  <li>Flickity (framework for carousel)</li>
</ul>
<br />

I decided to recreate this website because is a good way to see how Designer accomplish the creation of an application, the tools they used
and trying to replicate and to solve the problems you face doing this.

I accepted the challenge through the website: https://www.frontendpractice.com.
There i chose the application to replicate. 


<br>
The Pro designer who made the original application is  Niccolò Miranda.
