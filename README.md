# Deplace-Maison-clone-website
I challenged my front-end knowledge recreating a website. Take a look on: "https://www.deplacemaison.com" to test your skills.


Technologies used in the project:

• HTML/CSS
• Javascript
• JQuery
• GSAP (framework for animations)
• SASS 
• Flickity (framework for carousel)


I decided to recreate this website because is a good way to see how Designer accomplish the creation of an application, the tools they used
and trying to replicate and to solve the problems you face doing this.

I accepted the challenge through the website: https://www.frontendpractice.com.
There i chose the application to replicate. 

The Pro designer who made the original application is  Niccolò Miranda.
